        additions : [
            "- Prototyping and 3D printing: Trained by Mr. Daboussi Haithem, a mechatronic engineer and the founder of Maker Academy, the 25 participants had the chance to see all about 3D printing and computer-aided design (CAD) and witness the printing process of a piece right then and there.",
            "- Introduction to Building Information Modeling (BIM): This incredible workshop was presented at INSAT conference room by our trainer Mr. Wadii Hamdi, an industrial engineer and technical director at AUTODESK. The session was 3 hours long. The trainer gave the 45 participants golden pieces of advice on how to succeed in their professional interviews and write a presentable CV. He introduced two of the most used software in the BIM: AutoCAD is a commercial computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting software application, developed and marketed by Autodesk and Revit, a building information modeling software for architects, designers, contractors, and engineers from multiple fields: plumbing, structuring, mechanics, electricity... ",
            "- Introduction to AI in industry 4.0: This workshop was very interesting. It got trained by Mr. Omar Hajjouji, 4th-year instrumentation and industrial maintenance student at INSAT and the head of the learning department in Data Co-lab. The trainer introduced artificial intelligence and explained the importance of predictive maintenance. He focused on machine learning and the importance of the use of algorithms in ML. The participants had the chance to see how the collection of Data is happening. They witnessed how the algorithms can predict some situations in the future."
